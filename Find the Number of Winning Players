Problem Statement - 
You are given an integer n representing the number of players in a game and a 2D array pick where pick[i] = [xi, yi] represents that the player xi picked a ball of color yi.
Player i wins the game if they pick strictly more than i balls of the same color. In other words,
Player 0 wins if they pick any ball.
Player 1 wins if they pick at least two balls of the same color.
Player i wins if they pick at leasti + 1 balls of the same color.
Return the number of players who win the game.
Note that multiple players can win the game.

Example - 
Input: n = 4, pick = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[2,1],[2,1],[2,0]]
Output: 2

Solution - 
class Solution {
public:
    int winningPlayerCount(int n, vector<vector<int>>& pick) {
        vector<vector<int>>v(n, vector<int>(12, 0));
        int ans = 0;
        for(auto i:pick){
            if(v[i[0]][11]!=-1){
                v[i[0]][i[1]]++;
                if(v[i[0]][i[1]]>i[0]) v[i[0]][11] = -1, ans++;
                // cout<<i[0]<<" "<<i[1]<<" "<<v[i[0]][i[1]]<<endl;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
