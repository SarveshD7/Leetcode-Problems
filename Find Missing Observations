Problem Statement - 
You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. 
Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.
You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.
Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. 
If no such array exists, return an empty array.
The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.
Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.

Example - 
Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.

Solution - 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> missingRolls(vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int n) {
        long long s=0, rsum=0, mx=6, siz=0;
        vector<int>v;
        for(auto i:rolls) s+=i;
        rsum=(mean*(rolls.size()+n))-s;
        while(rsum>0 && n>0){
            if(rsum-mx>=n-1) rsum-=mx, v.push_back(mx), n--;
            else mx=rsum-n+1;
        }
        if(rsum>0){ 
            while(!v.empty()) v.pop_back();
        }
        return v;
    }
};
