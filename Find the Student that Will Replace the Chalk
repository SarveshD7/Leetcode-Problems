Problem Statement -
There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.
Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.

Example - 
Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.

Solution - 
class Solution {
public:
    int chalkReplacer(vector<int>& chalk, int k) {
        bool flag=true;
        long long i=0, s=0, a=0;
        for(auto j:chalk) s+=j;
        a=k/s;
        k-=(s*a);
        while(k>=chalk[i]){
            k-=chalk[i];
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
